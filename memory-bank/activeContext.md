# Active Context - Dance Registration Portal

## Current Work Focus

### Recently Completed (This Session)
- ✅ Email Integration Enhancement
  - Migrated from SMTP (blocked by Railway) to SendGrid API integration
  - `utils/mailer.js` now uses `@sendgrid/mail` with proper error handling
  - SendGrid API key configuration via `SENDGRID_API_KEY` environment variable
  - Confirmation emails sent via SendGrid when admin approves payments
  - Maintains same function signatures for backward compatibility

- ✅ Dual Payment Method Implementation (Venmo + Zelle)
  - Added Zelle payment option alongside existing Venmo flow
  - Server endpoints:
    - `POST /api/generate-venmo-link` (existing)
    - `POST /api/generate-zelle-payment` (new)
  - Frontend payment method selector:
    - Initial screen shows choice between Venmo and Zelle payment cards
    - Each method has dedicated payment flow with back navigation
    - Consistent UX patterns for both payment types
  - Zelle integration features:
    - Email and phone recipient options with copy buttons
    - Step-by-step payment instructions
    - Payment note generation with course details and dates
  - Default settings for both payment methods configurable via system settings
  - Mobile-responsive design with appropriate icons and styling

- ✅ Attendance workflow UX and visibility hardening
  - Paid-only roster in Manage Attendance:
    - Frontend now loads registrations with `GET /api/admin/registrations?course_id={id}&payment_status=completed`
    - Ensures only paid (completed) students appear when marking attendance
  - Individual Present/Late/Absent controls visible and functional:
    - Auto-select first available session after loading sessions so the right panel renders individual radios by default
    - Robust radio inputs: larger (20px), thick dark borders, visible checked inner dot, hover/focus styles, and dark mode variants
  - Readability on white backgrounds:
    - Stronger table gridlines (2px), zebra striping, subtle column tint for radio columns, explicit header backgrounds
    - High-contrast text for student names and headers
  - Suggested dates + one-click session creation:
    - Suggested dates derived from course metadata (duration_weeks/start_date or slot.day_of_week/practice_date)
    - One-click create `class_session` → auto-select → render roster
  - Persisted vs suggested ordering:
    - Persisted sessions always listed first; suggested dates appear below (non-persisted only)
  - Cache-busting:
    - `public/admin.html` now loads `css/admin-styles.css?v=7` and `js/admin.js?v=17` to guarantee latest assets in production
- ✅ Admin/UI polish related to attendance
  - “Students” card shows name with status badge; bulk actions retained
  - Hint text clarifies: “Select a status for each student or use the bulk buttons below.”

### Recently Completed (Previous Sessions)
- ✅ Repository reorganization: moved utility scripts to scripts/, docs to docs/, loose media to assets/media; updated server.js and package.json accordingly
- ✅ Railway build fix: run DB migrations at app start; removed NPM build script; lazy-loaded sqlite3 for dev only; moved sqlite3 to devDependencies; pushed to Railway to trigger deploy
- ✅ Admin payment approval flow finalized with confirmation email
  - Server `PUT /api/admin/registrations/:id/confirm-payment` marks payment as completed and sends confirmation email via Nodemailer when `email_notifications_enabled` is true
  - Email payload includes: courseName, computed schedule_info, amount, registrationId, studentName
  - Errors in email sending never fail payment update; endpoint returns flags: `email_sent`, `email_skipped`, `email_error`
  - Admin resend endpoint added: `POST /api/admin/registrations/:id/resend-confirmation` (requireAuth)
  - Admin debug endpoint added: `GET /api/admin/debug-email-config` to inspect transport detection (no secrets)
- ✅ Admin UI fixes for unclickable approval buttons
  - Loading overlay made non-interactive with CSS: `pointer-events: none`
  - Global handlers (window.quickConfirmPayment / window.markPaidModal) instrumented with console.info logs for diagnostics
  - Cache-busting (older): `js/admin.js?v=5`, `css/admin-styles.css?v=3`
  - Overlay safely hidden on window load and in finally blocks
- ✅ Student portal schedule display enhancement (slot-based, time-aware)
- ✅ Server computes schedule_info from slots (consistent across UIs)
- ✅ Cache-busting for registration.js
- ✅ DB boolean normalization and admin toggles
- ✅ Slot-based course architecture with per-slot pricing and capacity
- ✅ DDC branding/theme and student portal UX cleanups

## Current Status
- Attendance System: Core implemented and deployed
  - DB: `class_sessions`, `attendance_records` with `UNIQUE(session_id, student_id)`
  - APIs:
    - `GET /api/admin/courses/:courseId/sessions` (list)
    - `POST /api/admin/courses/:courseId/sessions` (create)
    - `GET /api/admin/sessions/:sessionId/attendance` (fetch)
    - `POST /api/admin/sessions/:sessionId/attendance` (bulk upsert)
    - `GET /api/admin/registrations?course_id=&payment_status=completed` (roster source)
  - UI: Sessions list on left; Students with individual radios on right; bulk actions; “Save Attendance” persists and refreshes marks
- Admin/UI: Buttons for payment confirmation are wired through global fallbacks and clickable
- Deployment: Railway auto-deploy on git push; production cache-busting in place (`admin-styles.css?v=7`, `admin.js?v=17`)
- Email stack: Nodemailer multi-mode config with diagnostics endpoints and resilient behavior remains active

## Architecture and Patterns (Relevant)
- Slot-Based Courses: source of truth for schedule_info and pricing (drives suggested attendance dates)
- Attendance patterns:
  - Suggested vs persisted sessions: suggested dates computed from course metadata and filtered to exclude existing sessions
  - Individual vs bulk updates: individual radios per student with bulk Present/Late/Absent/Clear operations; POST is bulk upsert
  - UI reliability: clear container before re-render, type-safe numeric comparisons for IDs, cache-busting query params to avoid stale JS/CSS
  - Visibility on light/dark themes: scoped selectors under `#attendanceStudents` for radios, headers, stripes, and gridlines, with dark-mode media query overrides
- Server routes (key):
  - Attendance:
    - `POST /api/admin/courses/:courseId/sessions`
    - `GET /api/admin/courses/:courseId/sessions`
    - `POST /api/admin/sessions/:sessionId/attendance`
    - `GET /api/admin/sessions/:sessionId/attendance`
  - Registrations/Export/Analytics: CSV export; by-series and by-status analytics endpoints
  - Payment confirmation + email: confirm, resend, debug-email-config
- Utilities:
  - `utils/mailer.js`: transport detection, debug logging, `sendRegistrationConfirmationEmail()`
  - `utils/schedule.js`: course+slots aggregation and schedule_info composition

## Next Steps and Priorities
- Attendance enhancements (Phase 3, follow-ups)
  - Attendance summary: per-session counts and percentages (present/late/absent) and per-student series completion %
  - Attendance export (CSV) for a session or entire series
  - Auto-select heuristic: default to most recent past or nearest upcoming session (instead of “first”)
  - Mobile ergonomics: larger tap targets; sticky bulk bar on small screens
- Admin efficiency
  - Bulk operations: checkbox selection for registrations; bulk email/status ops
  - Reporting dashboard: trends by series/status; refresh-on-demand
- Series lifecycle
  - Completed Series: archive view (non-destructive) and archival actions

## Acceptance Criteria (for current Phase 3 scope)
- Opening Manage Attendance with a course filter:
  - Only paid registrations populate the Students list after a session is selected
  - Individual Present/Late/Absent radios are clearly visible and selectable per student
- Creating a session from a suggested date:
  - Creates a persisted `class_session`, auto-selects it, and shows paid roster with individual radios
- Persisted sessions remain listed above suggested dates
- Bulk actions remain functional; “Save Attendance” persists marks (idempotent bulk upsert)

## Files Touched (this session)
- `public/css/admin-styles.css` (visibility hardening: gridlines, column tint, larger radios, zebra striping, header backgrounds, dark mode)
- `public/admin.html` (cache-bust admin CSS to `v=7`)
- Verified `public/js/admin.js` has:
  - Roster filtering to `payment_status=completed`
  - Auto-select first session after load
  - Individual radios and hint text rendering

## Deployment Notes
- Commit pushed to `main` triggers Railway deployment
- Hard refresh recommended; verify `css/admin-styles.css?v=7` and `js/admin.js?v=17` load in Network tab before validation

## Validation Checklist (Post-Deploy)
- Students names and radios are visible and readable on light background
- Column tint makes radios stand out; borders are thick enough; checked dot is visible
- Headers (Present/Late/Absent) readable in both themes
- Roster is paid-only; bulk actions and save work end-to-end
