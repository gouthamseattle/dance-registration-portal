# Active Context - Dance Registration Portal

## Current Work Focus (2025-09-18)

### ✅ Historical Student Classification System - COMPLETED & DEPLOYED
- ✅ **Planning Session Completed**: Designed one-time automated classification system
- ✅ **Implementation Completed**: Full system implemented with comprehensive error handling
- ✅ **Deployed to Production**: Successfully deployed to Railway with PostgreSQL database access
- ✅ **Student Portal Enhanced**: Email profile registration and improved UX deployed
- **Status**: FULLY OPERATIONAL - System can now identify crew members from "Dreamers Crew Practice" registrations

### Key Requirements Identified
1. **One-time classification script** to analyze existing student registration patterns
2. **Enhanced crew member visibility** in admin interface (names and emails prominently displayed)
3. **Database updates** for both PostgreSQL production and SQLite development
4. **Manual review interface** for admin to approve/reject classification suggestions

### Technical Implementation Plan

#### **Classification Logic**
```javascript
// Students who registered for crew_practice courses → suggest crew_member
// Students who only registered for drop-in/multi-week → keep as general
// Present suggestions to admin for bulk approval
```

#### **Database Updates**
```sql
-- For approved crew members:
UPDATE students 
SET student_type = 'crew_member', 
    admin_classified = true,
    updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP 
WHERE id IN (selected_student_ids);
```

#### **Enhanced Admin Interface Design**
```
Student Management Page:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🏆 CREW MEMBERS (12)                                    │
│ • John Smith (john@email.com) @johnsmith               │
│ • Sarah Wilson (sarah@email.com) @sarahw               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

👥 ALL STUDENTS
🏆 John Smith - john@email.com - CREW MEMBER
👤 Jane Doe - jane@email.com - General Student
```

### Implementation Components
1. **`scripts/classify-historical-students.js`** - Analysis and classification script
2. **Admin API endpoints** for classification review
3. **Enhanced Student Management UI** with crew member prominence
4. **Database migration safety** with backup and rollback capabilities

## Previously Completed Work

### Major System Implementations Completed

#### ✅ **Student Access Control System** (2025-09-17)
- **Problem Solved**: Successfully implemented differentiated access (crew practice vs drop-in)
- **Key Achievement**: Course creation bug fixed, access control working perfectly
- **Final Result**: 
  - General students see only courses with `required_student_type = 'any'`
  - Crew members see both general courses AND crew practice courses
  - Student access levels hidden from student view (admin-only visibility)

#### ✅ **Course Creation & Database Issues Resolved** (2025-09-17 Late)
- **Root Cause**: SQLite CHECK constraint preventing `'crew_practice'` course types
- **Solution**: Updated database constraint to allow all course types
- **Database Fix**: Recreated courses table with updated constraint: `CHECK(course_type IN ('multi-week', 'drop-in', 'crew_practice'))`
- **Verification**: Course creation and editing working perfectly on both development and production

#### ✅ **Email System Enhancement** (2025-09-17)
- **SendGrid Integration**: Migrated from blocked SMTP to SendGrid API
- **Deliverability Fixes**: Enhanced HTML templates, spam filter compatibility
- **Professional Email Structure**: Table-based layout, unsubscribe links, proper headers
- **Email Analysis Document**: Created `EMAIL_DELIVERABILITY_ANALYSIS.md` with actionable recommendations

#### ✅ **Payment Method Integration** (2025-09-17)  
- **Dual Payment Support**: Venmo + Zelle payment flows
- **Database Schema**: Added `payment_method` column to registrations table
- **Payment Configuration**: Updated Zelle to phone-only (Monica Radhakrishnan: 4252159818)
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/generate-venmo-link` and `/api/generate-zelle-payment`

#### ✅ **Attendance Management System** (2025-09-17)
- **Database Schema**: `class_sessions`, `attendance_records` with proper constraints
- **Admin Interface**: Sessions list with individual student attendance marking
- **API Endpoints**: Full CRUD for sessions and attendance records
- **UX Enhancements**: Bulk actions, visual indicators, mobile-responsive design

### Architecture & Patterns Established
- **Slot-Based Courses**: Source of truth for scheduling and pricing
- **Email-Based Recognition**: Student profile lookup and course filtering
- **Access Control**: `student_type` and `required_student_type` filtering
- **Admin Classification**: Manual review and approval workflow
- **Database Abstraction**: Works with both SQLite (dev) and PostgreSQL (production)

### Current System State
- **Student Profile System**: ✅ Complete with access control
- **Course Management**: ✅ All course types working (multi-week, drop-in, crew_practice)
- **Registration Flow**: ✅ Email-based recognition with pre-filled forms
- **Payment Processing**: ✅ Venmo & Zelle with confirmation emails
- **Admin Interface**: ✅ Full course and registration management
- **Access Control**: ✅ Working perfectly (crew vs general student filtering)
- **Database Schema**: ✅ All required columns exist and working

### Database Schema (Current)
```sql
-- Students table (existing, working):
students:
  - student_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'general'  -- 'general' | 'crew_member'
  - admin_classified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE      -- Has admin reviewed?
  - profile_complete BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE      -- Profile creation complete?
  - instagram_handle VARCHAR(255)               -- Contact info

-- Courses table (existing, working):
courses:
  - required_student_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'any'  -- 'any' | 'crew_member'
  - course_type VARCHAR(20)  -- 'multi-week' | 'drop-in' | 'crew_practice'

-- Registrations table (existing, working):
registrations:
  - payment_method TEXT  -- 'venmo' | 'zelle'
  - payment_status VARCHAR(20)  -- 'pending' | 'completed' | 'failed'
```

### Deployment & Production Status
- **Railway Deployment**: ✅ Auto-deploy on git push working
- **Production Database**: ✅ PostgreSQL with all schema updates
- **Development Environment**: ✅ SQLite with matching schema
- **Cache Management**: ✅ Proper cache-busting in place
- **Email Delivery**: ✅ SendGrid API integration working
