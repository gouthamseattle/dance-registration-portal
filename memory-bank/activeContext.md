## Detailed Planning Results (2025-09-17 Evening Session)

### Student Access Control System Design
**Problem**: Need to create drop-in classes open to all students while maintaining crew practice restricted to crew members only.

**Solution**: Email-based recognition system with admin-controlled student classification:
- Students enter email first → system recognizes them and filters available courses
- New students: email → profile creation → admin classification → future seamless access
- Returning students: email → auto-recognition → pre-filled registration

### Course Type Matrix (Planned)
| Feature | Multi-Week Series | Crew Practice | Drop-In Class (NEW) |
|---------|------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Access** | Open to All | Crew Members Only | Open to All |
| **Scheduling** | Weekly recurring | Single `practice_date` | Single `class_date` |
| **Slots** | Multiple allowed | Single slot only | Single slot only |
| **Pricing** | Full + Per-class | Full + Per-class | Per-class only |
| **Branding** | GouMo | DDC logos | Custom drop-in branding |
| **Form Fields** | Full profile | Name only | Profile-based (pre-filled) |
| **DB Field** | `course_type = 'series'` | `course_type = 'crew_practice'` | `course_type = 'drop_in'` |

### Database Schema Additions (Planned)
```sql
-- Student profile & access management
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN student_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'general';
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN profile_complete BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN admin_classified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- Course access control
ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN required_student_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'any';

-- Drop-in class support (reuse existing practice_date column as class_date)
```

### Student Experience Flows (Designed)

#### First-Time Student Flow:
1. **Email Entry**: `newstudent@email.com` → "Continue"
2. **Profile Creation**: System prompts for:
   - Full Name: `[____________]`
   - Instagram ID: `[@__________]` 
   - Dance Experience: `[Dropdown]`
3. **Admin Notification**: Student appears in "Pending Classification" panel
4. **Course Selection**: Shows courses based on default access (general student = drop-in only)
5. **Registration**: Form auto-filled from profile

#### Returning Student Flow:
1. **Email Entry**: `john@email.com` → System recognizes them
2. **Welcome Message**: "Welcome back, John Smith! (@johnsmith_dance)"
3. **Filtered Course Selection**: Shows courses based on their `student_type`
   - Crew members: See crew practice + drop-in classes
   - General students: See only drop-in classes
4. **Pre-filled Registration**: All personal info auto-populated

### Admin Interface Designs (Planned)

#### Student Management Dashboard:
```
📊 Student Overview:
- Total Students: 45
- Crew Members: 12  
- General Students: 30
- Pending Classification: 3

🆕 Pending Classification:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Jane Doe (jane@email.com) @janedance - Beginner        │
│ Registered: Oct 15, 2024 for "Hip Hop Drop-in"        │
│ [Mark as Crew Member] [Keep as General Student]        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

👥 All Students: [Search] [Filter by Type]
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ John Smith    john@email.com    @johnsmith    Crew      │
│ Sarah Wilson  sarah@email.com   @sarahw       General   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Course Creation Updates:
```
Course Type: [Dropdown]
├── Multi-Week Series (Open to All)
├── Crew Practice (Members Only) 
└── Drop-In Class (Open to All) ← NEW

[If Drop-In Class selected:]
✓ Single slot only
✓ Class Date: [Date Picker] 
✓ Per-class pricing only
✓ Custom drop-in branding
✓ Access: Open to All (auto-set)
```

### Implementation Roadmap (4 Phases)
**Phase 1: Student Profile System**
- Database schema updates
- Email-based profile lookup API
- Profile creation flow
- Admin student management interface

**Phase 2: Access Control System**
- Student type classification
- Course access filtering based on student_type
- Admin classification tools with built-in review interface
- Migration script to classify existing crew members from previous registrations

**Phase 3: Drop-In Class Support**
- New course type: `drop_in`
- Single date scheduling using `class_date` (reuse `practice_date` field)
- Per-class pricing only (no full course option)
- Custom drop-in branding system
- Admin course creation interface updates

**Phase 4: Enhanced Registration Flow**
- Auto-populated forms for returning students
- Course filtering by student eligibility
- Streamlined UX for all user scenarios
- Testing and refinement

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Email-based recognition**: More reliable than self-identification or codes
- **Admin-controlled classification**: You decide who gets crew access after seeing their profile
- **Reuse existing infrastructure**: Drop-in classes leverage crew practice patterns (single slot, single date)
- **Built-in admin interface**: No CSV upload/download needed - all managed through web interface
- **Automatic crew member detection**: Existing crew practice registrants auto-identified for your approval

**Status**: Planning complete, ready for implementation. Awaiting user direction to begin Phase 1.

### Recently Completed (This Session - 2025-09-17)
- ✅ Payment Confirmation Messaging Update
  - Fixed outdated payment confirmation text in frontend:
    - **From**: "We're rolling out email confirmations soon. We'll confirm your payment shortly."
    - **To**: "Registration received, We will confirm your payment and send an email confirmation"
  - Updated `showPaymentSentConfirmation()` function in `public/js/registration.js`
  - Reflects that email confirmations are now active and operational

- ✅ Email Deliverability Investigation & Comprehensive Fixes
  - **Root Cause Identified**: Using Gmail address (`goumodnzchronicles@gmail.com`) through SendGrid triggers spam filters
  - **Immediate Fixes Implemented**:
    - Enhanced HTML email template with professional table-based layout
    - Added plain text version for better spam filter compatibility
    - Included proper email headers (List-Unsubscribe, tracking settings)
    - Added unsubscribe link and copyright footer
    - Disabled click/open tracking to reduce spam signals
    - Improved email structure with professional styling and branding
  - **Created EMAIL_DELIVERABILITY_ANALYSIS.md**:
    - Comprehensive analysis of spam folder causes
    - Actionable recommendations for domain authentication
    - Priority-based implementation plan (immediate vs long-term solutions)
    - Testing strategies and monitoring recommendations
  - **Technical Implementation**:
    - Updated `utils/mailer.js` with enhanced SendGrid email configuration
    - Added both HTML and text versions to email messages
    - Included deliverability-focused headers and settings
    - Maintained backward compatibility with existing email functions

- ✅ Streamlined Registration Flow (Previously Completed)
  - Successfully implemented 2-page registration flow as requested
  - Integrated payment method selection directly into registration form
  - Fixed Venmo/Zelle text visibility issues with enhanced CSS styling
  - Updated cache-busting to v=53 for current deployment

### Previously Completed Sessions
- ✅ Email Integration Enhancement
  - Migrated from SMTP (blocked by Railway) to SendGrid API integration
  - `utils/mailer.js` now uses `@sendgrid/mail` with proper error handling
  - SendGrid API key configuration via `SENDGRID_API_KEY` environment variable
  - Confirmation emails sent via SendGrid when admin approves payments
  - Maintains same function signatures for backward compatibility

- ✅ Dual Payment Method Implementation (Venmo + Zelle)
  - Added Zelle payment option alongside existing Venmo flow
  - Server endpoints:
    - `POST /api/generate-venmo-link` (existing)
    - `POST /api/generate-zelle-payment` (updated with new configuration)
  - Frontend payment method selector:
    - Initial screen shows choice between Venmo and Zelle payment cards
    - Each method has dedicated payment flow with back navigation
    - Consistent UX patterns for both payment types
  - Zelle integration features:
    - Phone recipient option with copy button (email removed)
    - Step-by-step payment instructions
    - Payment note generation with course details and dates
  - Default settings for both payment methods configurable via system settings
  - Mobile-responsive design with appropriate icons and styling

- ✅ Attendance workflow UX and visibility hardening
  - Paid-only roster in Manage Attendance:
    - Frontend now loads registrations with `GET /api/admin/registrations?course_id={id}&payment_status=completed`
    - Ensures only paid (completed) students appear when marking attendance
  - Individual Present/Late/Absent controls visible and functional:
    - Auto-select first available session after loading sessions so the right panel renders individual radios by default
    - Robust radio inputs: larger (20px), thick dark borders, visible checked inner dot, hover/focus styles, and dark mode variants
  - Readability on white backgrounds:
    - Stronger table gridlines (2px), zebra striping, subtle column tint for radio columns, explicit header backgrounds
    - High-contrast text for student names and headers
  - Suggested dates + one-click session creation:
    - Suggested dates derived from course metadata (duration_weeks/start_date or slot.day_of_week/practice_date)
    - One-click create `class_session` → auto-select → render roster
  - Persisted vs suggested ordering:
    - Persisted sessions always listed first; suggested dates appear below (non-persisted only)
  - Cache-busting:
    - `public/admin.html` now loads `css/admin-styles.css?v=7` and `js/admin.js?v=17` to guarantee latest assets in production
- ✅ Admin/UI polish related to attendance
  - “Students” card shows name with status badge; bulk actions retained
  - Hint text clarifies: “Select a status for each student or use the bulk buttons below.”

### Recently Completed (Previous Sessions)
- ✅ Repository reorganization: moved utility scripts to scripts/, docs to docs/, loose media to assets/media; updated server.js and package.json accordingly
- ✅ Railway build fix: run DB migrations at app start; removed NPM build script; lazy-loaded sqlite3 for dev only; moved sqlite3 to devDependencies; pushed to Railway to trigger deploy
- ✅ Admin payment approval flow finalized with confirmation email
  - Server `PUT /api/admin/registrations/:id/confirm-payment` marks payment as completed and sends confirmation email via Nodemailer when `email_notifications_enabled` is true
  - Email payload includes: courseName, computed schedule_info, amount, registrationId, studentName
  - Errors in email sending never fail payment update; endpoint returns flags: `email_sent`, `email_skipped`, `email_error`
  - Admin resend endpoint added: `POST /api/admin/registrations/:id/resend-confirmation` (requireAuth)
  - Admin debug endpoint added: `GET /api/admin/debug-email-config` to inspect transport detection (no secrets)
- ✅ Admin UI fixes for unclickable approval buttons
  - Loading overlay made non-interactive with CSS: `pointer-events: none`
  - Global handlers (window.quickConfirmPayment / window.markPaidModal) instrumented with console.info logs for diagnostics
  - Cache-busting (older): `js/admin.js?v=5`, `css/admin-styles.css?v=3`
  - Overlay safely hidden on window load and in finally blocks
- ✅ Student portal schedule display enhancement (slot-based, time-aware)
- ✅ Server computes schedule_info from slots (consistent across UIs)
- ✅ Cache-busting for registration.js
- ✅ DB boolean normalization and admin toggles
- ✅ Slot-based course architecture with per-slot pricing and capacity
- ✅ DDC branding/theme and student portal UX cleanups

## Current Status
- Payment Method Tracking: Backend infrastructure complete
  - Database: `payment_method` column added to registrations table (VARCHAR(10) for PostgreSQL, TEXT for SQLite)
  - Zelle Configuration: Updated to phone-only with recipient "Monica Radhakrishnan" at 4252159818
  - API: `/api/generate-zelle-payment` returns new phone-based configuration without email
  - Ready for frontend integration to capture and store selected payment method
- Attendance System: Core implemented and deployed
  - DB: `class_sessions`, `attendance_records` with `UNIQUE(session_id, student_id)`
  - APIs:
    - `GET /api/admin/courses/:courseId/sessions` (list)
    - `POST /api/admin/courses/:courseId/sessions` (create)
    - `GET /api/admin/sessions/:sessionId/attendance` (fetch)
    - `POST /api/admin/sessions/:sessionId/attendance` (bulk upsert)
    - `GET /api/admin/registrations?course_id=&payment_status=completed` (roster source)
  - UI: Sessions list on left; Students with individual radios on right; bulk actions; "Save Attendance" persists and refreshes marks
- Admin/UI: Buttons for payment confirmation are wired through global fallbacks and clickable
- Deployment: Railway auto-deploy on git push; production cache-busting in place (`admin-styles.css?v=7`, `admin.js?v=17`)
- Email stack: SendGrid API integration active with confirmation email flow

## Architecture and Patterns (Relevant)
- Slot-Based Courses: source of truth for schedule_info and pricing (drives suggested attendance dates)
- Attendance patterns:
  - Suggested vs persisted sessions: suggested dates computed from course metadata and filtered to exclude existing sessions
  - Individual vs bulk updates: individual radios per student with bulk Present/Late/Absent/Clear operations; POST is bulk upsert
  - UI reliability: clear container before re-render, type-safe numeric comparisons for IDs, cache-busting query params to avoid stale JS/CSS
  - Visibility on light/dark themes: scoped selectors under `#attendanceStudents` for radios, headers, stripes, and gridlines, with dark-mode media query overrides
- Server routes (key):
  - Attendance:
    - `POST /api/admin/courses/:courseId/sessions`
    - `GET /api/admin/courses/:courseId/sessions`
    - `POST /api/admin/sessions/:sessionId/attendance`
    - `GET /api/admin/sessions/:sessionId/attendance`
  - Registrations/Export/Analytics: CSV export; by-series and by-status analytics endpoints
  - Payment confirmation + email: confirm, resend, debug-email-config
- Utilities:
  - `utils/mailer.js`: transport detection, debug logging, `sendRegistrationConfirmationEmail()`
  - `utils/schedule.js`: course+slots aggregation and schedule_info composition

## Next Steps and Priorities
- Payment Method Tracking Completion
  - Update frontend registration flow (`public/js/registration.js`) to capture selected payment method
  - Pass payment method ("venmo" or "zelle") to backend during registration submission
  - Update admin interface to display payment method in registration listings
  - Test both Venmo and Zelle payment flows end-to-end with method tracking
- Admin Interface Enhancement
  - Display payment method column in admin registrations table
  - Filter/sort by payment method options
  - Bulk operations: checkbox selection for registrations; bulk email/status ops
  - Reporting dashboard: trends by series/status; refresh-on-demand
- Attendance enhancements (Phase 3, follow-ups)
  - Attendance summary: per-session counts and percentages (present/late/absent) and per-student series completion %
  - Attendance export (CSV) for a session or entire series
  - Auto-select heuristic: default to most recent past or nearest upcoming session (instead of "first")
  - Mobile ergonomics: larger tap targets; sticky bulk bar on small screens
- Series lifecycle
  - Completed Series: archive view (non-destructive) and archival actions

## Acceptance Criteria (for current Phase 3 scope)
- Opening Manage Attendance with a course filter:
  - Only paid registrations populate the Students list after a session is selected
  - Individual Present/Late/Absent radios are clearly visible and selectable per student
- Creating a session from a suggested date:
  - Creates a persisted `class_session`, auto-selects it, and shows paid roster with individual radios
- Persisted sessions remain listed above suggested dates
- Bulk actions remain functional; “Save Attendance” persists marks (idempotent bulk upsert)

## Files Touched (this session)
- `server.js` (major updates):
  - Updated default Zelle settings in `/api/settings` endpoint (recipient name and phone)
  - Added payment_method column migration in `initializeDatabase()` 
  - Fixed PostgreSQL syntax in attendance_records table creation (removed AUTOINCREMENT)
  - Updated `/api/generate-zelle-payment` endpoint to use new configuration and remove email option
  - Database migration handles both SQLite dev and PostgreSQL production environments
- Database schema:
  - Added `payment_method` column to `registrations` table
  - Column supports "venmo" and "zelle" values for tracking payment method choice

## Deployment Notes
- Commit pushed to `main` triggers Railway deployment
- Hard refresh recommended; verify `css/admin-styles.css?v=7` and `js/admin.js?v=17` load in Network tab before validation

## Validation Checklist (Post-Deploy)
- Students names and radios are visible and readable on light background
- Column tint makes radios stand out; borders are thick enough; checked dot is visible
- Headers (Present/Late/Absent) readable in both themes
- Roster is paid-only; bulk actions and save work end-to-end
