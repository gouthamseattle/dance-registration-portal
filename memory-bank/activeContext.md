# Active Context - Dance Registration Portal

## Current Work Focus (2025-09-18)

### ✅ Admin Registrations Management Enhancements - COMPLETED & DEPLOYED
- Features: Admin can Cancel, Uncancel, and Edit registrations
  - Cancel sets payment_status = 'canceled' and records canceled_at, canceled_by, cancellation_reason
  - Uncancel restores to payment_status = 'pending'
  - Edit allows updating student name/email/phone and payment_amount
- Emails: Cancellation email sent via SendGrid when email_notifications_enabled is true
- API Endpoints (auth required):
  - PUT /api/admin/registrations/:id/cancel  { reason?: string }
  - PUT /api/admin/registrations/:id/uncancel
  - PUT /api/admin/registrations/:id/edit    { first_name?, last_name?, email?, phone?, payment_amount? }
- UI:
  - Registrations table actions: View, Edit, Cancel (or Uncancel when canceled)
  - Status filter includes “Canceled”
  - Badge style for status-canceled
  - Cache-busting: admin-styles.css?v=10, admin.js?v=19
- Deployment: Triggered via git push (commit c2a2386)


### ✅ Historical Student Classification System - COMPLETED & DEPLOYED
- ✅ **Planning Session Completed**: Designed one-time automated classification system
- ✅ **Implementation Completed**: Full system implemented with comprehensive error handling
- ✅ **Deployed to Production**: Successfully deployed to Railway with PostgreSQL database access
- ✅ **Student Portal Enhanced**: Email profile registration and improved UX deployed
- **Status**: FULLY OPERATIONAL - System can now identify crew members from "Dreamers Crew Practice" registrations

### Key Requirements Identified
1. **One-time classification script** to analyze existing student registration patterns
2. **Enhanced crew member visibility** in admin interface (names and emails prominently displayed)
3. **Database updates** for both PostgreSQL production and SQLite development
4. **Manual review interface** for admin to approve/reject classification suggestions

### Technical Implementation Plan

#### **Classification Logic**
```javascript
// Students who registered for crew_practice courses → suggest crew_member
// Students who only registered for drop-in/multi-week → keep as general
// Present suggestions to admin for bulk approval
```

#### **Database Updates**
```sql
-- For approved crew members:
UPDATE students 
SET student_type = 'crew_member', 
    admin_classified = true,
    updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP 
WHERE id IN (selected_student_ids);
```

#### **Enhanced Admin Interface Design**
```
Student Management Page:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🏆 CREW MEMBERS (12)                                    │
│ • John Smith (john@email.com) @johnsmith               │
│ • Sarah Wilson (sarah@email.com) @sarahw               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

👥 ALL STUDENTS
🏆 John Smith - john@email.com - CREW MEMBER
👤 Jane Doe - jane@email.com - General Student
```

### Implementation Components
1. **`scripts/classify-historical-students.js`** - Analysis and classification script
2. **Admin API endpoints** for classification review
3. **Enhanced Student Management UI** with crew member prominence
4. **Database migration safety** with backup and rollback capabilities

## Previously Completed Work

### Major System Implementations Completed

#### ✅ **Student Access Control System** (2025-09-17)
- **Problem Solved**: Successfully implemented differentiated access (crew practice vs drop-in)
- **Key Achievement**: Course creation bug fixed, access control working perfectly
- **Final Result**: 
  - General students see only courses with `required_student_type = 'any'`
  - Crew members see both general courses AND crew practice courses
  - Student access levels hidden from student view (admin-only visibility)

#### ✅ **Course Creation & Database Issues Resolved** (2025-09-17 Late)
- **Root Cause**: SQLite CHECK constraint preventing `'crew_practice'` course types
- **Solution**: Updated database constraint to allow all course types
- **Database Fix**: Recreated courses table with updated constraint: `CHECK(course_type IN ('multi-week', 'drop-in', 'crew_practice'))`
- **Verification**: Course creation and editing working perfectly on both development and production

## Recent Session Work (2025-09-18 Evening)

### ✅ EMAIL-FIRST REGISTRATION SYSTEM RESTORED & ENHANCED
- **Issue Identified**: DOM errors and data flow problems preventing email-first workflow
- **Root Cause**: JavaScript registration.js causing crashes on email-profile.html page
- **Solution Applied**: Comprehensive defensive programming throughout registration system
- **Key Fixes**:
  - Fixed `renderCourses()`, `renderDropInClasses()`, `setupEventListeners()` DOM access errors
  - Added null checks for all DOM element access to prevent TypeError crashes
  - Fixed `showPaymentSection()` method for cross-page compatibility
  - Resolved field name mismatch: `instagram_handle` vs `instagram_id` consistency
  
### ✅ STUDENT DATA VALIDATION & INTEGRATION ENHANCED
- **Profile Data Integration**: Registration form now uses existing student profile data automatically
- **Field Name Consistency**: Fixed `instagram_handle` vs `instagram_id` mismatch across systems
- **Smart Data Validation**: Added comprehensive validation for missing/null profile data
- **Graceful Error Handling**: System handles incomplete profiles with helpful error messages
- **Crew Practice Exception**: Special handling for crew courses that don't require Instagram/experience

### ✅ COURSE ACCESS CONTROL ISSUE DIAGNOSED
- **New Issue Discovered**: "Course Full" showing when admin can register but students cannot
- **Root Cause Identified**: Access control restrictions (`required_student_type`) blocking students
- **Debug Tools Created**: 
  - `/api/admin/debug/course-capacity/:courseId` - Detailed capacity analysis
  - `/api/admin/debug/course-access/:courseId` - Access control diagnosis
- **Issue Type**: Not a capacity bug, but access control configuration blocking general students

### ✅ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENTS COMPLETED
1. **DOM Error Fixes**: All registration system crashes resolved
2. **Field Name Consistency**: Instagram handle data now flows correctly
3. **Profile Integration**: Students no longer re-enter data already collected
4. **Debug Tools**: Course access and capacity analysis endpoints deployed

### Files Modified & Deployed (2025-09-18 Evening Session)
- **✅ `public/js/registration.js`** - Comprehensive defensive programming, DOM error fixes, field name consistency
- **✅ `server.js`** - Added debug endpoints for course capacity and access control analysis
- **✅ Git commits & Railway deployment** - All fixes live in production

### Current System Status (Post-Evening Session)
- **✅ Email-First Registration**: Fully operational without DOM crashes
- **✅ Student Profile Integration**: No duplicate data collection
- **✅ Data Validation**: Robust error handling for incomplete profiles  
- **✅ Debug Tools**: Ready to diagnose course access control issues
- **⚠️ Pending Resolution**: "Course Full" issue (likely access control configuration)

### ✅ PROFILE VALIDATION ISSUE RESOLVED (2025-09-18 Evening)
- **Issue Identified**: Profile validation inconsistency causing "profile appears to be incomplete" error with no way for users to complete missing information
- **Root Cause**: Email-profile system only checked crew member profiles, but main registration system validated ALL users at payment time
- **Solution Applied**: Updated `/api/check-student-profile` to validate ALL users for profile completeness after email entry
- **Key Changes**:
  - Profile now considered incomplete if missing `instagram_handle` OR `dance_experience`
  - All users (not just crew members) redirected to profile completion when incomplete
  - Eliminates dead-end error at payment time
- **Files Modified**: `server.js` - profile validation logic in `/api/check-student-profile`
- **Deployment**: Successfully deployed to Railway (commit ff5f40d)

### Current System Status (Post-Profile Fix)
- **✅ Email-First Registration**: Fully operational without DOM crashes
- **✅ Profile Validation**: Now checks ALL users and redirects to completion immediately
