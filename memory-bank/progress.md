# Progress - Dance Registration Portal

## What Works (Completed Features)

### ‚úÖ Core Infrastructure
- Express server with proper middleware and static file serving
- DatabaseConfig abstraction handles SQLite (dev) and PostgreSQL (prod)
- Session management tuned for Railway (secure=false, httpOnly, sameSite=lax)
- Unified async error handling via asyncHandler
- Environment switching and migrations wired for production

### ‚úÖ Student Registration System
- Course listing with capacity computed from slot capacities
- Registration form (mobile-optimized, validated)
- Automatic student create/update on registration
- Overbooking prevention (registration vs capacity checks)
- Mobile-first design and WhatsApp-friendly sharing

### ‚úÖ Payment Processing
- Venmo deep link flow with mobile app handoff and desktop QR code
  - POST /api/generate-venmo-link returns venmoLink, webLink, paymentNote, venmoUsername
  - Desktop QR code generated client-side (api.qrserver.com)
  - ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Sent the Payment‚Äù flow and pending confirmation state
- Admin confirm payment endpoint to mark registration as completed
- Payment status tracking persisted in registrations

### ‚úÖ Admin Dashboard
- Secure login with bcrypt password hashing
- Course CRUD with slot-based architecture (multi-slot support)
- Real-time registrations view
- Dashboard stats (registrations, revenue, active courses, pending payments)
- Course types and constraints: crew practice limited to one slot

### ‚úÖ Database Management
- Dual DB support (SQLite dev, Postgres prod)
- Automatic migration on production deploy
- Slot-based schema: course_slots, course_pricing
- Data integrity via FKs and cascade deletes

### ‚úÖ Production Deployment
- Railway auto-deploys on git push
- PostgreSQL managed by Railway
- HTTPS domain for production
- Cache-busting added for client assets to mitigate stale caching
- Build pipeline stabilized: run DB migrations at app start (not during build); removed npm build script; sqlite3 is dev-only and lazy-loaded

### ‚úÖ Security Implementation
- Password hashing (bcryptjs)
- Session security (httpOnly, sameSite)
- Parameterized queries throughout
- Server-side validation

### ‚úÖ Student Portal UX Improvements
- Schedule shows Day + Start-End time + Location across UI
  - Cards: slot-based details with date range appended
  - Selected Course Info: per-slot lines + separate Dates section
  - Confirmation: server-computed schedule_info ensures times/dates
- Removed technical ‚Äúsaved with ID‚Äù messaging from payment UI
- Hidden ‚ÄúAvailable spots‚Äù from student-facing UI
- Crew Practice: Instagram ID field changes to ‚ÄúFull Name‚Äù; Dance Experience hidden
- Removed üí∞ emoji from total amount; cleaner total display
- Cache-busting for registration.js

### ‚úÖ Transactional Emails (New)
- Nodemailer integration with multi-mode transport detection:
  - EMAIL_SERVICE (e.g., gmail), or EMAIL_HOST/EMAIL_PORT, or implicit Gmail fallback with EMAIL_USER/EMAIL_PASSWORD
- Email sender resolution via EMAIL_FROM or NAME + ADDRESS fallback
- Confirmation email automatically sent on admin payment approval:
  - PUT /api/admin/registrations/:id/confirm-payment updates status and sends email (when system setting email_notifications_enabled='true')
  - Email includes courseName, computed schedule_info, amount, registrationId, and studentName
  - Endpoint never fails due to email errors; returns flags: email_sent, email_skipped, email_error
- Resend endpoint: POST /api/admin/registrations/:id/resend-confirmation
- Debug endpoint: GET /api/admin/debug-email-config (no secrets; shows chosen transport, presence of envs)
- EMAIL_DEBUG=true enables safe runtime detection logs

### ‚úÖ Admin UI Reliability (New)
- Loading overlay made non-interactive to avoid intercepting clicks if it remains visible (pointer-events: none)
- Overlay is also hidden in finally blocks and on window load as a safety
- Global handlers exposed on window:
  - window.quickConfirmPayment(regId)
  - window.markPaidModal(regId)
- Click diagnostics added via console.info in global handlers
- Cache-busting bumped for admin assets:
  - admin.html -> js/admin.js?v=5, css/admin-styles.css?v=3

## What Changed Recently (Server + Frontend + Repo)

### Server
- GET /api/courses computes schedule_info from slots + course dates
- Confirm payment flow:
  - PUT /api/admin/registrations/:id/confirm-payment
  - POST /api/admin/registrations/:id/resend-confirmation
  - GET /api/admin/debug-email-config
- Capacity check rewritten with subqueries and numeric coercion

### Frontend
- registration.js/card rendering: slot-based schedule display with time-aware details
- admin.js/admin.html:
  - Global quick confirm and mark-paid handlers wired via window.*
  - Click logging added to global handlers for diagnostics
  - Overlay safety changes
  - Cache-busting for admin.js and admin-styles.css
- Student portal selection flow hardening:
  - Numeric ID matching for courses and drop-ins to avoid string/number mismatch across DB drivers
  - Defensive fetch/JSON parsing with response.ok and status checks
  - Debounce selection clicks (isSelecting / isSelectingDropIn) to prevent races
  - Suppress error toast after successful navigation (only show if not on 'form' step)
  - Refresh course list on back navigation to avoid stale state
  - Robust Instagram/Name field toggle for crew practice
  - Guard errors in showRegistrationForm UI prep (non-blocking)
  - Cache-busted registration.js to v=49

### Repository
- Repository reorganization: moved utility scripts to scripts/, docs/ to docs/, loose media to assets/media/.
- Updated references: server now requires ./scripts/migrate-to-postgres; npm run setup points to scripts/setup.js.
- Fixed SQLite path in scripts/migrate-to-postgres.js; aligned scripts/setup.js to use bcryptjs to match dependencies.

- 37e19a4 ‚Äî Build fix: run DB migrations at app start; remove build script; lazy-load sqlite3; move sqlite3 to devDependencies

## Post-First-Class Feedback (Admin Portal) ‚Äî Sept 2025
- Duplicate registrations observed for the same course with the same displayed ID
- Status filter not working on registrations page
- "Failed to export registrations" error when clicking Export All
- Dance Series filter not working
- Some registrations still show pending even after confirmation
- Need registration ID shown prominently across Admin UI (tables, detail modals, confirmation dialogs, CSV export)

## Clarified Requirements
- Attendance tracking:
  - Track both per-session attendance and overall series completion
  - Attendance is for records only (does not affect payment status)
  - Mobile-friendly interface for marking during class
- Series cleanup:
  - Move finished series to a "Completed Series" section (archive, do not delete)
- Reporting dashboard:
  - Refresh on navigation to the page (no real-time push needed)
  - Checkbox-based selection for bulk operations

## Implementation Plan (Phased)
1) Phase 1: Critical Fixes
   - Investigate duplicate registration issue (same ID display) and prevent duplicates
   - Fix Status and Series filters in admin UI
   - Repair CSV Export (server route + client trigger)
   - Ensure payment confirmation clears stale "pending" in the UI/model
   - Add Registration ID prominently across Admin UI and CSV

2) Phase 2: Reporting & Bulk Operations
   - APIs for analytics (counts/lists by series and status)
   - Admin reporting dashboard with on-demand refresh
   - Checkbox-based bulk edit/delete actions
   - Series archival (move to Completed)

3) Phase 3: Attendance Tracking
   - Schema: class_sessions (per-date), attendance_records (per-student per-session)
   - API endpoints for attendance CRUD
   - Mobile-first attendance UI and summary reports (per-session and % series completion)

4) Phase 4: Enhanced Admin Experience
   - Completed Series management surface
   - Bulk communications, additional quality-of-life improvements

5) Phase 5: Testing & Validation
   - Validate duplicate-prevention and filter/export fixes with real data
   - Verify reporting accuracy and attendance workflow
   - UAT in production deployment

## Current Status Overview

### üü¢ Fully Operational
- Slot-based course creation and display
- Student registration and Venmo payment initiation
- Admin management and dashboard stats
- Production deployment and auto-deploy flow
- Time-aware schedule visible across UI
- Transactional email on admin payment approval (with resend support and config debug endpoint)
- Admin UI approval buttons responsive; overlay cannot block clicks

### üü° Partially Implemented
- CSV export surface in admin UI (core export exists; enhance per-course export UX)

### üî¥ Not Started
- Bulk email interface in Admin
- Advanced analytics/reporting
- Multi-instructor support
- Student self-service dashboard
- Waitlist management

## Known Issues and Limitations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Considerations
1. Email delivery depends on valid SMTP credentials and provider policies; use GET /api/admin/debug-email-config and set EMAIL_DEBUG=true for diagnostics.
2. Drop-in classes endpoint currently returns an empty array (placeholder).

### üêõ Minor Issues
1. Error UI copy could be improved in some flows
2. Some admin features could be more mobile-friendly
3. Loading indicators could be further enhanced in payment steps

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Still Valid
- Vanilla JS and Bootstrap for speed and simplicity
- Dual DB abstraction for dev/prod parity
- Railway as deployment target
- Slot-based course as source of truth (schedule/pricing/capacity)

### Evolved Decisions
- Server-computed schedule_info replaces hand-authored schedule text for consistency
- Student payment UX prioritizes Venmo deep link/QR flow
- Cache-busting added to client asset URLs to ensure immediate rollout
- Transactional emails sent on admin approval with resilient error handling and explicit resend

## Success Metrics Achieved

### ‚úÖ Technical
- Mobile load performance sustained
- Reliable deployment pipeline via git push
- Consistent, time-aware schedule rendering across views
- Transactional emails integrated and configurable

### ‚úÖ UX
- Clear schedule presentation
- Cleaner payment UI without technical noise
- Reliable admin approval actions with helpful toasts

### ‚úÖ Business
- Professional student-facing presentation
- Fewer schedule-related student questions
- Post-payment confirmations emailed on approval

## Next Development Priorities

### High Priority (Next Sprint)
1. CSV Export UX: Enhance admin export options (per-course, filtered)
2. Admin diagnostics UI for email config (optional surface for /api/admin/debug-email-config)

### Medium Priority
1. Bulk Email Interface in Admin
2. Enhanced Reporting: Basic analytics views
3. Improve error and loading states further

### Low Priority
1. Multi-instructor support and roles
2. Student dashboard and receipt downloads
3. Calendar integrations

## Phase 1 ‚Äî Critical Fixes Implemented (Sept 2025)

### Server
- Added CSV export endpoint: GET /api/admin/registrations/export?course_id=&payment_status=
  - Applies filters server-side (course_id, payment_status)
  - Generates a properly escaped CSV (handles quotes, commas, newlines) with headers and ISO date-based filename
- Added registration de-duplication guard in POST /api/register
  - If a completed registration exists for (student, course) ‚Üí block with a clear error
  - If a pending registration exists ‚Üí return that registration ID (idempotent behavior) instead of creating a duplicate

### Admin UI
- Registration ID displayed prominently:
  - Added ID to Recent Registrations table
  - Added ID as first column in Registrations table
  - Registration Details modal shows Registration ID
- Fixed ‚ÄúDance Series‚Äù filter with type-safe comparison: Number(r.course_id) === Number(selected)
- Export button now opens server CSV export and preserves current filters (course and status)

### Deployment
- Cache-busted admin script in public/admin.html to js/admin.js?v=12

### Files Touched
- public/js/admin.js (ID columns, filter fix, export wiring, modal details)
- public/admin.html (cache-bust to v=12)
- server.js (CSV export route, registration de-duplication)

### Validation Plan (Post-Deploy)
1. Hard refresh admin; verify js/admin.js?v=12 is loaded (Network tab).
2. Registrations:
   - Set Course and Status filters; click ‚ÄúExport All‚Äù ‚Üí CSV downloads with matching rows.
   - Approve a pending registration ‚Üí row updates to completed after data reload.
3. Attempt duplicate registration for same email and course:
   - If completed exists ‚Üí receive error.
   - If pending exists ‚Üí receive existing registrationId with deduped: true.

## Phase 3 ‚Äî Attendance Workflow & Visibility (Sept 2025)

### Frontend (Admin UI)
- Paid-only roster in Manage Attendance:
  - Roster loads via `GET /api/admin/registrations?course_id={id}&payment_status=completed`
  - Ensures only paid (completed) students appear for marking
- Individual Present/Late/Absent controls:
  - Auto-selects first available session post-load so the Students panel always renders radios
  - Bulk actions retained: All Present/Late/Absent/Clear
- Visibility hardening on light/dark themes:
  - Stronger gridlines and explicit header backgrounds
  - Subtle column tint for radio columns to make radios pop
  - Larger radios (20px) with thick borders and visible inner dot on checked
  - Zebra striping for improved readability, high-contrast text for names/headers
  - Dark mode overrides for borders and checked dot color
- Suggested dates panel:
  - Derived from course metadata (duration_weeks/start_date or slot.day_of_week/practice_date)
  - One-click create persisted `class_session`, auto-select, render roster
- Persisted sessions prioritized:
  - Persisted sessions listed; suggested dates shown beneath (filtered to non-persisted)
- Cache-busting:
  - `admin-styles.css?v=7`, `admin.js?v=17` to avoid stale production assets

### Backend (APIs/Data)
- Attendance tables:
  - `class_sessions`, `attendance_records` with `UNIQUE(session_id, student_id)`
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /api/admin/courses/:courseId/sessions`
  - `POST /api/admin/courses/:courseId/sessions`
  - `GET /api/admin/sessions/:sessionId/attendance`
  - `POST /api/admin/sessions/:sessionId/attendance`
  - Roster source: `GET /api/admin/registrations?course_id=&payment_status=completed`

### Deployment
- Commit `a450d07` ‚Äî Attendance UI visibility: strengthen contrast for student names and radio columns; add gridlines and column tint; increase radio size; cache-bust admin-styles.css to v=7

### Acceptance Criteria (Met)
- Opening Manage Attendance with a course filter loads only paid registrations once a session is selected
- Individual radios visible and functional per student; bulk actions work; Save persists to DB
- Suggested date ‚Üí creates session ‚Üí auto-selects ‚Üí renders paid roster
- Persisted sessions remain listed above suggested dates

### Next Follow-ups
- Attendance summary (per-session counts and series completion %)
- Attendance export (CSV) for session/series
- Auto-select heuristic improvement (nearest upcoming or most recent)
- Mobile ergonomics (sticky bulk bar, larger tap targets)
