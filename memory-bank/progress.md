# Progress - Dance Registration Portal

## What Works (Completed Features)

### ‚úÖ Core Infrastructure
- Express server with proper middleware and static file serving
- DatabaseConfig abstraction handles SQLite (dev) and PostgreSQL (prod)
- Session management tuned for Railway (secure=false, httpOnly, sameSite=lax)
- Unified async error handling via asyncHandler
- Environment switching and migrations wired for production

### ‚úÖ Student Registration System
- Course listing with capacity computed from slot capacities
- Registration form (mobile-optimized, validated)
- Automatic student create/update on registration
- Overbooking prevention (registration vs capacity checks)
- Mobile-first design and WhatsApp-friendly sharing

### ‚úÖ Payment Processing
- Venmo deep link flow with mobile app handoff and desktop QR code
  - POST /api/generate-venmo-link returns venmoLink, webLink, paymentNote, venmoUsername
  - Desktop QR code generated client-side (api.qrserver.com)
  - ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Sent the Payment‚Äù flow and pending confirmation state
- Admin confirm payment endpoint to mark registration as completed
- Payment status tracking persisted in registrations

### ‚úÖ Admin Dashboard
- Secure login with bcrypt password hashing
- Course CRUD with slot-based architecture (multi-slot support)
- Real-time registrations view
- Dashboard stats (registrations, revenue, active courses, pending payments)
- Course types and constraints: crew practice limited to one slot

### ‚úÖ Database Management
- Dual DB support (SQLite dev, Postgres prod)
- Automatic migration on production deploy
- Slot-based schema: course_slots, course_pricing
- Data integrity via FKs and cascade deletes

### ‚úÖ Production Deployment
- Railway auto-deploys on git push
- PostgreSQL managed by Railway
- HTTPS domain for production
- Cache-busting added for registration.js to mitigate stale caching

### ‚úÖ Security Implementation
- Password hashing (bcryptjs)
- Session security (httpOnly, sameSite)
- Parameterized queries throughout
- Server-side validation

### ‚úÖ Student Portal UX Improvements (Latest)
- Schedule now shows Day + Start-End time + Location across UI
  - Cards: slot-based details with date range appended
  - Selected Course Info: per-slot lines + Dates section
  - Confirmation: server-computed schedule_info ensures times/dates
- Removed technical ‚Äúsaved with ID‚Äù messaging from payment UI
- Hidden ‚ÄúAvailable spots‚Äù from student-facing UI
- Crew Practice: Instagram ID field changes to ‚ÄúFull Name‚Äù; Dance Experience hidden
- Removed üí∞ emoji from total amount; cleaner total display
- Cache-busting for registration.js to avoid stale assets after deploy

## What Changed Recently (Server + Frontend)

### Server (Courses endpoint)
- schedule_info is now computed from slots and course dates
  - Format example: ‚ÄúFridays 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM at Studio G (9/20/2025 - 11/1/2025)‚Äù
  - If only start_date: ‚Äú(Starts 9/20/2025)‚Äù
- Returns slots with pricing, capacity aggregates, available spots
- Normalizes is_active for SQLite (1/0) vs Postgres (true/false) on updates

### Frontend (registration.js, index.html)
- Course cards: schedule built from course.slots; date range appended
- Selected Course Info: per-slot schedule + separate Dates section
- Fallback to course-level times if slot times are missing
- Confirmation relies on server-computed schedule_info (now time-aware)
- Cache-busting query param added to registration.js script tag

### Commits Deployed
- 45ddfb5 ‚Äî Show slot times on cards and form; add fallback to course-level times; fix duplicate variable declarations
- 75511bb ‚Äî Compute schedule_info on server from slots (include start/end times and dates) and cache-bust registration.js

## Current Status Overview

### üü¢ Fully Operational
- Slot-based course creation and display
- Student registration and Venmo payment initiation
- Admin management and dashboard stats
- Production deployment and auto-deploy flow
- Time-aware schedule visible across UI

### üü° Partially Implemented
- Email system (nodemailer configured; not wired into registration flow)
- CSV export wiring in UI
- QR codes surfaced for Venmo desktop flow; admin QR tooling TBD

### üî¥ Not Started
- WhatsApp message templates (admin-side)
- Advanced analytics/reporting
- Multi-instructor support
- Student self-service dashboard
- Waitlist management

## Known Issues and Limitations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations
1. Email notifications not yet triggered on registration/payment
2. CSV export not exposed in admin UI
3. Admin bulk comms tooling not implemented
4. Drop-in classes endpoint currently returns an empty array
5. Some browser caches may retain older JS without cache-busting

### üêõ Minor Issues
1. Error UI copy could be improved for clarity in some flows
2. Some admin features could be more mobile-friendly
3. Loading indicators could be enhanced in payment steps

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Still Valid
- Vanilla JS and Bootstrap for speed and simplicity
- Dual DB abstraction for dev/prod parity
- Railway as deployment target
- Slot-based course as source of truth (schedule/pricing/capacity)

### Evolved Decisions
- Server-computed schedule_info replaces hand-authored schedule text for consistency
- Student payment UX prioritizes Venmo deep link/QR flow
- Cache-busting added to client asset URLs to ensure immediate rollout

## Success Metrics Achieved

### ‚úÖ Technical
- Mobile load performance sustained
- Reliable deployment pipeline via git push
- Consistent schedule rendering across all views

### ‚úÖ UX
- Clear, time-explicit schedule presentation
- Cleaner payment UI without technical noise
- Conditional form fields for crew practice

### ‚úÖ Business
- Professional student-facing presentation
- Fewer student follow-ups on schedule ambiguity
- Admins can confidently confirm Venmo payments

## Next Development Priorities

### High Priority (Next Sprint)
1. Email Integration: Send confirmation emails with the computed schedule (server-side)
2. CSV Export: Admin UI button to export registrations per course
3. Admin QR/WhatsApp Sharing: Quick-share with schedule snippet

### Medium Priority
1. Bulk Email Interface in Admin
2. Enhanced Reporting: Basic analytics views
3. Improve error and loading states

### Low Priority
1. Multi-instructor support and roles
2. Advanced analytics dashboards
3. Student dashboard and receipt downloads
4. Calendar integrations
